# R3DGUI
R3DGUIs are SurfaceGuis that take place of regular roblox ScreenGuis

Springs are used by Quenty's nevermore: [src/spring/src/Shared/Spring.lua](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/blob/main/src/spring/src/Shared/Spring.lua)

# Pros:
* Add depth to your games
* Removes the flatness that screenGuis give
* Make them more interactable with what you do **(IE: shaking from camera movement)**

# Cons:
* Not alot of customizability
* Very long screens cause guis to be pushed away from their correct offset
* Spaghetti code *mostly*, expect bugs or weird methods in source code
